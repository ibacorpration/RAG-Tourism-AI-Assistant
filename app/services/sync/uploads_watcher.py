class UploadsWatcher:
    """
    Polls the uploads directory on a fixed interval and detects files that
    were removed directly from disk (e.g. deleted manually, not through the
    API). Whenever a previously-seen file disappears, its vectors/chunks are
    purged from the vector store so the RAG index never answers from stale,
    deleted documents.

    Polling (rather than OS-level file events) is used deliberately: it
    works reliably across Docker volumes / network mounts / WSL where
    inotify-style events are often missed, at the small cost of a short
    detection delay (poll_interval_seconds).
